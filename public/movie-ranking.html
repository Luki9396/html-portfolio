  <p>There is not enough talk about how terrific the early episodes of DBZ are that sets up future arcs. You are suddenly revealed that Goku now has a Kid named Gohan who is trapped in a forest and almost about to die and just when Goku is about save him, Gohan saves himself by miraculously teleporting to a safe spot before drowning. The entire scene is treated as if it was a fluke and nothing else.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, an Alien lands on Earth extremely pissed at a person called Kakarot who failed to kill every single Human on planet. Goes to look after the strongest person on Planet but ends up finding Piccolo who gets shivers and forgets to breath just at the sight of Raditz. You know how much of a big deal this is if you have followed Dragon Ball from its humble beginning.</p>
  <p>Raditz ends up finding Goku and we are reveal that the person "Kakarot" he is looking for is actually Goku and he is his brother. Master Roshi reveals to Goku that Grandpa Gohan once said to him that Goku hit his head as a child and lost all the memory. However, Raditz is far more pissed at the fact that Goku doesn't have his tail anymore and disgracing his saiyan heritage and thus, lost the ability 
     to transform at full moon to which Goku doesn't realize what he is talking about. However, Krillin, Master Roshi and Bulma knows and have experienced the terror first hand.</p>
  <p>I know there are a lot of Raditz apologist here that Akira Sensei didn't do much with his character. But, he is just straight up evil threatening to Kill his Nephew if Kakarot fails to kill 100 Humans by tomorrow. Master Roshi and Krillin offers to help Goku, but the stakes are raised extremely high when Goku reveals that Kami said Shenron can only revive the same person once.</p>
  <p>Enter Piccolo, Goku's biggest rival to offer temporary truce to fight Raditz together. Meanwhile, Raditz put Gohan in his ship and his scouter suddenly reads 700 power level from Gohan twice but Raditz still think his scouter is malfunctioning. Only to realize the bitter truth that it wasn't when Goku and Piccolo approaches him!</p>
  <p>Piccolo and Goku realize the harsh truth that there are 2 more saiyans who far more stronger than Raditz when they struggling against someone like Raditz. To which Piccolo replies "Goku you must be excited to fight someone so strong" but Goku said this "Sorry, but i am not excited this time infact i am so afraid right now that i am trembling". I am watching the original Japanese Broadcast audio and all
     of these dialogues that stays true to Goku's character are missing in Dub.</p>
  <p>Anyway, this post is going on for too long. However, i can't emphasis enough that how great this build up is with multiple side storyline building up also explaining Goku's origin and saiyan lore. </p>

  <p>The anime was full of filler episodes. But, both the anime and the manga conveyed a lot of emotion. The character development was amazing, showing the complexities of the heroes and villains both, revealing a twisted logic that you could feel and comprehend.</p>
  <p>The fight scenes are badass: The art is amazing, the uniqueness of the storyline engaging. Bleach is just one of the best expressions of all the vibrancy of human nature. You can feel yourself cheering for the characters the whole time.</p>

<h3>3. Demon Slayer</h3>

  <p>There are probably some of you out there who are into Japanese anime. Well I recently started watching the Japanese anime called, “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba”. It is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Koyoharu Gotōge, and it is about Tanjiro Kamado, a young boy who becomes a demon slayer after his family is slaughtered and his younger sister Nezuko is turned into a demon. I wasn’t 
     sure what the hype was all about until I started watching the anime with my 8-year-old son, who actually started watching the anime way before me.The image below is of Tanjiro.</p>
  <p>Though quite difficult to explain, Tanjiro and another character Tomioka use what’s called, “Mizu no Kokyuu” which is a kata using a katana, creating what appears to be a water wheel of water. Total concentration is needed to perform mizu no kokyuu. The image below shows Tanjiro using the mizu no kokyuu to fight off a demon.
     And after watching the first episode, I got hooked on the intro song. If you who are interested in Japanese pop music, the intro song is a must hear. The title is, “Gurenge” by Lisa, a Japanese singer-songwriter. There is an English version which you can find on YouTube, but I prefer the original, no offense of course.
     I would love to write more about Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba but I’ll end here, leaving you in suspense. I hope you get to watch it soon. I’m about to start on watching the twentieth episode.
     If you are signed up with any of the major streaming services then you should be able to find it there. It is worth watching</p>
